# Authentication Failure Bug - Scenario A

The authentication failure bug in Scenario A simulates a common production incident where a JWT secret key rotation inadvertently invalidates all existing user sessions. When the JWT secret key was updated from its original value to include a `-ROTATED` suffix in the `application.properties` file, the application began using the new secret for token validation while users still held tokens that were signed with the old secret. This mismatch causes the JWT validation process in `DefaultJwtService.java` to fail when parsing existing tokens, resulting in authentication errors for users who were previously logged in, even though their credentials remain valid and new logins work correctly with tokens generated using the updated secret key.
