# Memory Leak Bug - Scenario D

The memory leak bug in Scenario D demonstrates a critical resource management issue where unbounded collections cause continuous memory growth until application failure. The bug was introduced through a new `ArticleCacheService` that implements caching and user analytics tracking using `ConcurrentHashMap` collections without any size limits or eviction policies. The service includes an `articleCache` that stores article data indefinitely and a `userViewHistory` that accumulates user viewing patterns in ever-growing lists. Although a scheduled `cleanupCache()` method was added to address memory management, it only logs cache sizes without actually removing any entries, creating a false sense of cleanup while memory consumption continues to grow. This pattern leads to OutOfMemoryError crashes after 6-8 hours of normal operation, as the collections consume increasing amounts of heap space that can never be reclaimed by garbage collection due to active references being maintained in the static cache maps.
