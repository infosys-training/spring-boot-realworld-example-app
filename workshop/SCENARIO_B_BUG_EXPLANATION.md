# Missing Articles Bug - Scenario B

The missing articles bug in Scenario B demonstrates a common database query optimization issue where a performance improvement inadvertently breaks functionality. The bug was introduced when the article listing queries in `ArticleReadService.xml` were modified to use `INNER JOIN` instead of `LEFT JOIN` for the `article_tags` table relationship. This change means that only articles with at least one tag will appear in the main articles listing, while articles without tags are completely filtered out of the results, even though they exist in the database and are accessible via direct URL access. The issue showcases how small SQL query modifications can have significant functional impact and highlights the importance of understanding JOIN types when optimizing database queries.
